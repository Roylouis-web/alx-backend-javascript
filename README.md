# alx-backend-javascript

This repository contains all javascript code required in my alx backend engineer specialisation. It covers a lot of in depth concepts such as:

- The newly added ES6 syntax and declarations like const, let iterator, iterable, spread operator, rest parameters, default parameters etc

- Core usage of the concept of Promises in javascript and how to effectly handle Promises using the new async await syntax

- The introduction of 'class' in javascript which is know to be a syntactic sugar of the javascript constructor function

- Introduction to data manipulation with javascript using http request

- Introduction to nodejs which is a javascript runtime for server side scripting and help a lot of backend engineers to use javascript not just in the frontend but also the backend

- Unittests in javascript and its importance in preventing errors in after deployment
